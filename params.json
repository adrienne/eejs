{"name":"EEJS","body":"EEJS is a javascript library that helps you to develop ExpressionEngine add-ons by giving \r\nyou easy access to EE settings and channel information from within your javascript library.\r\n\r\nCurrently early in development, the aim of this library is to open up information within \r\nthe ExpressionEngine installation so that it can be easily consumed by JS libraries.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\neejs.config('webmaster_email'); \r\n// webmaster@example.com\r\n\r\neejs.action('Member', 'register_member');   \r\n// 10 \r\n\r\neejs.templateUrl('foo/bar')                 \r\n// http://example.com/index.php/foo/bar/\r\n\r\neejs.actionUrl('Member', 'member_login')    \r\n// http://example.com/?ACT=15\r\n\r\neejs.cpUrl({C:'content_edit'})              \r\n// http://example.com/system/index.php?S=ce589fec13376e2bfa5d058116b&D=cp&C=content_edit\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe library is packaged as an ExpressionEngine extension. \r\n\r\n* Copy the <code>system/expressionengine/third_party/eejs</code> folder to the same \r\nlocation in your EE installation\r\n* Install the extension by logging into your EE control panel and going to \r\nAdd-ons &rarr; Extensions and then installing the Eejs extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nSorry, but this is still to be done.  \r\n\r\nIf you have time on your hands, or are insanely interested, you can have a look through the\r\nbehaviour tests <code>system/expressionengine/third_party/eejs/tests/spec/EejsSpec.js</code> to see\r\nhow the module currently works!\r\n\r\nIf you're feeling super helpful you could even fork, write some documentation and submit\r\na pull request!","tagline":"An ExpressionEngine extension that provides access to EE settings and resources from client side JavaScript libraries.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
